package chapter8

// Kotlin promotes design by contract, where interfaces serve as
// specifications and classes as implementors of those contracts.
// You can also reuse implementations, in addition to specifications,
// by creating abstract classes.

// Classes are final by default and you have to explicitly annotate
// them as open to serve as a base class.

// You can define classes as sealed and thus state which specific
// classes may extend from those.
